### **Project Overview**

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of children's well-being in the United States, exploring the intricate relationships between childhood stress, family support systems, and the broader socio-economic environment.

The core uniqueness of this analysis lies in its multi-level approach. By merging two powerful datasets, we investigate children's mental health through both a micro-level lens (individual experiences and family dynamics) and a macro-level lens (state-wide economic and social indicators), providing a holistic view of the factors at play.

### **Key Research Questions**

This project sought to answer the following questions:

1. How are Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) associated with children's mental health?

2. Can positive family factors, such as good communication, act as a "buffer" against the stress of ACEs?

3. How does a state's economic condition (e.g., poverty rate) correlate with the prevalence of behavioral problems in children?

4. Is a state's education level associated with parents' feelings of neighborhood safety?

5. Does a relationship exist between housing stability (renter vs. owner-occupied) and child depression at the state level?

### Key Findings & Visualizations

This analysis yielded several key insights, some of which confirmed initial hypotheses while others revealed more complex, non-linear relationships.

### Finding 1: ACEs are a Powerful Risk Factor for Behavioral Problems

The analysis revealed a strong, dose-response relationship between the number of ACEs a child experiences and the likelihood of having behavioral problems. The association with behavioral problems was found to be substantially stronger than the link with depression.

- **Statistical Evidence:** A Spearman's correlation test confirmed a significant, positive relationship (``rho = 0.1037``, ``p < 0.001``).

  - **What this chart shows:** This bar chart illustrates the relationship between the cumulative number of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) a child has faced (x-axis) and the percentage of children diagnosed with behavioral problems (y-axis). Each bar represents a group of children with a specific ACE score, from 0 to 8.

  - **Key Insight:** The visualization reveals a stark and powerful dose-response relationship. As the ACE score increases, the prevalence of behavioral problems rises dramatically. For children with zero adverse experiences, the rate is a modest 7.7%. However, for children who have experienced seven ACEs, this figure skyrockets to 49.2%, meaning nearly one in every two children in this group faces behavioral challenges. This finding strongly indicates that cumulative childhood trauma is a major risk factor for developing behavioral problems.


### Finding 2: The "Buffering Hypothesis" is More Complex Than Assumed

Our initial hypothesis was that good family communication would simply weaken the link between ACEs and depression. The data revealed a more nuanced reality: the very nature of the relationship is different. For children with good communication, the link is weak and linear. For those with poor communication, the link is complex and non-linear, indicating that a simple "buffering" model is insufficient.

- **Statistical Evidence:** In the poor communication group, the correlation was unexpectedly negative (``rho = -0.1227``), highlighting a complex, non-monotonic relationship that warrants further study.

### Finding 3: State-Level Economy is Significantly Linked to Child Welfare

At the macro level, a state's economic health correlates with children's well-being. We found a moderate, positive linear relationship between a state's poverty rate and its prevalence of child behavioral problems.

  - What this chart shows: This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between state-level economic conditions and children's mental health. Each point represents a U.S. state.

    - The horizontal axis (x-axis) shows the state's poverty rate (%).

    - The vertical axis (y-axis) shows the prevalence of child behavioral problems (%) in that state.

    - The size and color of each point correspond to the state's median household income, providing an additional layer of economic context.

    - The red dashed line represents the linear regression trend, showing the overall direction of the relationship.

  - Key Insight: The upward slope of the regression line indicates a moderate positive linear correlation between poverty and behavioral issues. States with higher poverty rates tend to have a higher prevalence of behavioral problems among children. This suggests that the broader economic environment is a significant factor associated with child welfare on a macro level. The analysis was statistically validated with a Pearson's correlation test, which confirmed a significant relationship (``r = 0.3496``, ``p < 0.05``).

### Finding 4: Statistical Rigor Over-rules Visual Intuition
Two of our macro-level hypotheses, while appearing plausible on scatter plots, were refuted by statistical testing. We found no statistically significant evidence to support a link between:

1. A state's education level and parents' perception of safety (``p > 0.05``).

2. A state's percentage of renters and the prevalence of child depression (``p > 0.05``).

This was a critical finding, underscoring the importance of statistical validation to avoid drawing conclusions from potentially random patterns in the data.

### How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/Sosnovskyi-Bohdan/Childrens-Health-Analysis

2. Download the NSCH data: Obtain the ``nsch_2023e_topical.sas7bdat`` file from the official [NSCH website](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/data/datasets.2023.html#list-tab-491554181) and place it in the project directory.

3. Set up API Key: Get a free API key from the [Census Bureau](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html). In the Google Colab notebook, save it as a secret named ``CENSUS_API_KEY``.

4. Run the notebook: Open ``Childrens-Health-Analysis.ipynb`` in Google Colab and execute the cells sequentially.

### Limitations & Future Work
- Limitations:

  - Correlation vs. Causation: This analysis identifies associations, not causal links.

  - Self-Reported Data: The NSCH data relies on parental reports, which can be subject to bias.

  - Ecological Fallacy: State-level correlations do not necessarily apply to individuals within those states.

- Future Work:

  - Advanced Modeling: Employ regression models to control for multiple variables simultaneously and quantify the impact of each factor more precisely.

  - Geographic Granularity: If data becomes available, repeat the macro-level analysis at the county level to uncover more localized trends.
